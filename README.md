This is a web-app written in the Yesod framework in Haskell.

It's currently accessible [here]( http://squatpal.com) but it probably won't be for long.

I wanted to explore using Haskell for coding for the web using Yesod, but in the end decided it is too much effort and pain â€“ I was able to do the equivalent in Rails much faster.

Nevertheless, I'll leave this here in case you are interested in developing in Haskell+Yesod and would like some non-trivial example app.
